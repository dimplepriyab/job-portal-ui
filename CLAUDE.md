# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, JS/JSX only)
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

## Architecture

React 19 SPA using Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, and React Router 7. No TypeScript — plain JSX throughout.

### State Management

Two layers of React Context:

- **`src/context/`** — Core contexts: `AuthContext` (auth + dummy users + localStorage persistence), `JobContext` (applications, saved jobs, employer job CRUD), `ThemeContext`
- **`src/contexts/`** — Data-fetching contexts: `JobsDataContext` (cached job list with 5-min TTL), `CompaniesContext`

Provider nesting order (in App.jsx): AuthProvider → JobsDataProvider → JobProvider → CompaniesProvider → ThemeProvider

### Data Layer

Currently uses **mock data** with localStorage persistence — no real backend. Services in `src/services/` simulate async API calls using `delay()` from `src/utils/delay.js`. Data originates from `src/data/mockData.js`.

Key localStorage keys: `jobPortalUser`, `authToken`, `registeredUsers`, `globalPostedJobs`, `jobApplications_{userId}`, `savedJobs_{userId}`, `postedJobs_{userId}`.

### Routing & Roles

Three roles with route protection via `ProtectedRoute` component:
- **ROLE_JOB_SEEKER** — profile, applied-jobs, saved-jobs
- **ROLE_EMPLOYER** — post-job, employer/jobs, job-applicants/:jobId
- **ROLE_ADMIN** — admin/*, admin pages in `src/pages/admin/`

### Key Libraries

- Font Awesome + Lucide React for icons
- react-toastify for notifications

### ESLint

Flat config (`eslint.config.js`). The `no-unused-vars` rule ignores variables starting with uppercase or underscore (`varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'`).

## Git and GitHub Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/...` — New features or enhancements
- `fix/...` — Bug fixes
- `docs/...` — Documentation changes

### Branch Rules

- Always create branches from `main`
- Keep branches short-lived
- Delete branches after they are merged

### Pull Requests

- Open a pull request when the work is ready

### Commit Message Format

- Use one of these prefixes: `feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style`
- Write in present tense (e.g., "add" not "added")
- Use lowercase throughout
- No period at the end of the subject line
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Add a commit message body when the change is not obvious

### Code Standards

- Follow the existing project coding, testing, and linting standards
